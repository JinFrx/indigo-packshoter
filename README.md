## Description

**Indigo Packshoter** is a simple graphical tool in *Python 3.9* for *Indigo Renderer* engine to create packshots.

This tool allows you to assign different simple materials (flat colors, no blending) from a local materials folder (.igm files) to an Indigo object (.igs file).
You can also assign an Indigo camera (.igs file) to an Indigo scene (.igs file).
The packshot is generated by launching a render of the scene through a subprocess that calls the Indigo Renderer console executable (you have to give to Indigo Packshoter the path to the executable though).

The project supports **a notice** ("notice_indigo_pakshoter.pdf"), where the main aspects of the tool are detailed: for the assumed user and for the assumed developer.

A preview scene is available under the directory "preview_scenes".
Indigo files and directories that might be opened with the tool are located in the sub-directory "mat_db".

The Indigo Packshoter executable is generated with the *pyinstaller* module.

:clipboard: **NOTE:**

Because this project was made for the purpose of university work (2022) and because there is currently no interest for me to work on it: **No proper redesign or update are planned at the moment**.
Still, if I had to redesign it, I won't make it by using *tkinter* module (I would rather use the *Qt binding* for instance).
